## Crazed Tank

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - Crazed Bahamut is your only non-Uber backliner option for this stage. At level 20, he does enough damage to oneshot the Gories and Owlbrows, and half of Duche’s health.
-   **Crazed Cat** - A fast meatshield is basically required here so Crazed Tank doesn’t push super far. Without him, you would get destroyed by Owlbrows and Gories.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Paris Cat** - Paris can help a lot with the Duches and Gories. If you choose to use Paris, however, you cannot use CPU. Other alternatives to Paris include Castaway, Drama and Weightlifter, although they perform worse.
-   **Bath Cat** - Basically a second Dragon Cat. Helps a lot just with being more stackable DPS.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Generic Backliner Ubers** - B.C.S  Tigerclaw, Jizo’s Megacastle, Catman, etc.
-   **Shadow Gao** - Outranges everything here by a good margin and has Massive Damage towards nearly everything, including the boss, here.

> **Note:** This strategy can be rather inconsistent, even if you try to follow the video as closely as possible and have very similar levels, so you may need to retry more than a few times. Should CBahamut die without being close to being off cooldown, you’re most likely screwed.
  
Finally, Sniper is very important here as a powerup as your only accessible method of pushing back CTank and regaining ground from it. Now onto the actual strategy.  
  
At the start of level, build up and level up your wallet a bit (but leave enough to spawn CBaha quickly), lure the Snaches near base and use a couple of Walls to stall them. Once the Gories come, spam a few meatshields before then spawning Bahamut to quickly kill the Gories. After they’re dead, continue stalling the Snaches with Walls. Once Owlbrowos come, switch to spamming a few meatshields. Once the Duches spawn, you can basically just turn on CPU and Sniper and let them do the job from here.

  

  
  

## Crazed Axe

  
  
**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - One of your few accessible Backliner options which can outrange C. Axe and chip at it and also help deal with peons.
-   **Sanzo Cat** - Aside from the boss himself, the Shy Boys are the other big threat. Sanzo brings them down to a manageable level by slowing them.  
-   **Spammable Attackers** - Useful for dealing with Shy Boys quickly before they can stack up and push too hard. Examples include Cameraman, Elemental Duelist and Paris.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Sexy Bathtub Cat** - With Massive Damage to Red enemies, it can do alot of damage to the Shy Boys as well as do some damage to Crazed Axe due to outranging it.
-   **Ururun Wolf** - Another decent damager that outranges Crazed Axe. Comes with the ability to push him back at a small rate, which can be helpful if you’re struggling to keep him off your base.  
      
    

**Useful Uber Rare Units**  
  

-   **Anti-Red/Floating Nukers** - Able to dish out massive damage to the Shy Boys and do some chip to CAxe as well. Examples include Catman, Pai-Pai, B.C.S Tigerclaw, etc.

Start the stage by luring Crazed Axe at least half way across the field. Then, stall him using Crazed Tanks. You should be able to build up a decent amount of money before the Sir Seals arrive, which by then you use all your meatshields as well as Cameraman. Once the first Shy Boy arrives, turn on your CPU. This stage is decently boost-to-win, with spamming your units being the main strategy. If you ever run low on money (which should not be a problem in this stage), remember to turn off the CPU. Once Crazed Axe has died, it should mostly be a free win.

  

It should be noted if you are using Paris or Elemental Duelist, it’s generally not recommended to use CPU due to how much money each can drain if CPU is left on.  
  

## Crazed Gross

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Decent Tankers** - Core units for the tanker strategy. Examples include CTitan, CWhale, Island and Jameira.  
-   **Decent Spammable Ranged Attackers** - Helps for the ranged stack strat to make juggling CGross easier. Examples include Paris, Dragon Cat, Drama Cats, Macho Legs Cat and Crazed Dragon Cat.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Octopus Cat** - Practically breaks the stage if you do own him. Spamming a few meatshields, Octopus, some spammable ranged attackers leads to an easy win.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Tankers** - Examples include Dark Beastlord Garu, Cat Machine, Guardian Gamereon, etc. for the Tanker strat, like Crazed Titan and the other units you're bringing, they tank hits and dish out damage.
-   **Kasa Jizo** - For the ranged stack strat, acts the same as most ranged attackers you're bringing, but better.
-   **Anti-Wave Ubers** - Examples include Shadow Akira, Epicfest exclusive Ubers, Hell Sentinel Emma, Anubis the Unblemished, etc. As they can ignore the waves from Crazed Gross (Cat Machine and Hell Sentinel Emma blocking the waves) they can deal damage while also being unharmed.

- +Rich, Sniper   
  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaUZimTB6kY) - Courtesy of Jolyne Cujoh  
  
Cool Japan combo is very helpful here but if you don't have it, you can use a Defense Up with extra attackers or another Attack Up combo. Rich is necessary for spamming and Sniper helps also. 

Very straightforward. Lure the first Crazed Gross around midfield, before then basically spamming Paris and Dragon (and any other ranged attackers you bring) until your victory.  
  
**Tanker Strat**  
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QMUUbBtpChyA1Cs8kFQFU4WnRKU-jSyg_bT8DcR9OEFoLeP3sG7TPuCMTzoXjLl1Aump74QPmJj7T-SVUVnco1dFh1j7U8nQSbCske7_7qqMi2O5hUEoorGRdLpsuyAm6kLgSHYuAPD0bUK2eg)

Fisherman is here for the Moby Dick defence combo. Defence combos are rather helpful here as they allow your units to tank more of CGross’s hits. If you lack Moby Dick specifically, other defence combos can suffice. If you lack any, your best bet is hoping your extra levels, units or ubers may make up for the lack of one. Now onto the main strategy.

  

Also very straightforward. Lure the first Crazed Gross around midfield, then spam Whale, CTitan and CWhale (or any other Tankers/Wave Immune attackers you bring) until your victory.

## Crazed Cow

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat**  - A backliner that deals a hefty amount of damage to deal with the CCow hordes, practically essential for this stage. Can nearly ohkb a stack of Crazed Cows at level 20.
-   **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Spammable AoE attackers are essential for this stage to deal extra damage to control the CCow hordes in between Bahamut’s attack cycles. Examples include Cameraman, Paris, Castaway, UFO, etc.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Valkyrie Cat** - If you have absolutely no other options such as the lineup below, Valkyrie Cat is an option as another damage dealer.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**
  

-   **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Most first form Ultra Souls ubers such as Kasa Jizo should work here, performing similarly to Paris.  
-   **Generic Backliners** - Most ubers with better stats than C. Bahamut can serve as an upgrade, improving consistency. Examples include Catman, Nurse, Vars, etc.
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers** - Epicfest Exclusives such as Shadow Gao or D’arktanyan perform excellently in this stage due to their anti-Traitless abilities or just raw stats.

-   +CPU, Rich Cat (optional)
    

  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H0TpD3-OL0) - Courtesy of kuruluu

  

CPU is necessary to bring to this stage for effective spamming, but do be wary of draining cash. It's also reccomended to not use UFO and Paris together as they will drain cash. Rich also helps for the start off. 

At the start, send a few meatshields to kill Bunnies and level your wallet as much as possible. When the first CCow appears, send out a single Paris Cat along with meatshields to try to stall CCow and start maxing out your wallet.

Once the Crazed Cow is dead, stop sending units and wait for the horde to spawn. Then, lure the horde to around halfway, and then turn on CPU and watch the stage. Make sure to be wary of your wallet and spam manually if your wallet is too low.

Eventually the Crazed Cow flow should slow down meaning you've effectively won.

## Crazed Bird

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Whale Cat** - Absolutely carries this stage with good HP and damage. He is able to chip down both Rain D. and Crazed Bird, as well as having Strong vs Red, making him very useful for the Bore waves.
-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - A solid backliner only sent out during Bore and Shy Boy waves, and will also deal damage to Rain Ds during those waves.
-   **Spammable Ranged Attackers** - Units such as Paris, Dragon, Crazed Lizard, etc. can help by supporting Bahamut during the Bore phases and can also work for the Rain D phases.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Swimmer Cat** - Has Massive DMG vs Floating as well as good speed, allowing him to chip Crazed Bird consistently, speeding up the process. Can also be used during the Bore and Shy Boy waves.
-   **Kotatsu Cat** - Has Resistant vs Floating as well as 50% chance to weaken Crazed Bird, allowing your Crazed Whales to chip more consistently as they can tank for longer. Do not send this unit during Bore waves as they will die fast.
-   **Hip Hop Cat** - Works to chip Crazed Bird if no Rain Ds are alive, and works on the Bore phase as well, having a 40% chance to slow him and deal good damage.
-   **Sniper the Recruit** - Able to outrange CBird, as well as having a 100% chance to KB, allowing you to gain back ground from Crazed Bird.
-   **Other Anti-Red Units** - Units such as Swordsman Cat, Bath Cat, Sushi Cat, can all work against the Bores, making them much easier to deal with.
    

  
**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Backliner Ubers** - Ubers with decent range can be a good replacement for Bahamut during Bore waves, allowing you to keep more ground. A good example is Thundia.
-   **Rusher Ubers** - Ubers such as D’arktanyan or Yukimura who have high speeds can be used to rush down Crazed Bird, dealing a good amount of damage.
-   **Tanker Ubers** - High-HP Ubers such as Hades will be able to tank Crazed Bird and Rain Ds, as well as dealing good damage.
-   **Super Galaxy Cosmo** - Acts similarly to Sniper the Recruit, outranging the boss, as well as having decent chip damage, and a 100% chance to KB Crazed Bird. Very valuable to have in this stage.

-   +Sniper
    

  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQBxgzmbZrc) - Courtesy of kuruluu

  

Sniper is useful since Crazed Bird only has 1 KB, allowing you a method of pushing him back to gain back ground other than the Cat Cannon.

  

The main strategies consist of cycling units for each enemy. Use units which can chip at CBird (CWhale in this lineup) when CBird is alone. When Rain D is out, use your spammable attackers (CWhale in this lineup). When Bore comes out, send out Bahamut, your ranged attackers and meatshields along with any anti-Red units you’ve brought.  

Should Shy Boy appear, spam meatshields along with any anti-Red you’ve brought. Repeat this cycle until CBird is dead, meaning you’ve basically won.

## Crazed Fish

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - Your main Backliner for this stage, can take off a huge chunk of HP from a stack of Crazed Fishes.
-   **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Needed here to deal with the hordes of Crazed Fishes quickly. Examples include Paris, Drama and Castaway.
-   **A Critical Hit Unit that can outrange Super Metal Hippoe** - Common examples include Space Cat and Jurassic Cat's True Form, Catasaurus. Do note that Jurassic Cat has to be true formed in order to work here.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Tank Cat** - Can tank a good amount of hits from Crazed Fish, making it a very good meatshield for this stage. Very helpful for consistency.
    

  
  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Kasa Jizo** - Can act similarly to Paris Cat and Drama Cats.
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers:** Dark’tanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, etc.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJCXp_KbSEA)  - Similar strategy with no Crazed Wall, courtesy of Gardangle  
  

Onto the main strat. At the start, use a few meatshields and a Paris to get money from the beginning Crocos, and slowly save up for Crazed Bahamut. Then, once you have enough, spawn CBahamut and spam meatshelds with a few Paris's. Once you've killed the first CFish, you can start to stack more Paris's but be wary of cash and the unit limit.
  
Once you're nearing the Base, you can start spamming you critters. Then once the Super Metal Hippoe is dead, the stage should be free for you to beat.

## Crazed Lizard

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Tankers** - Needed here to be able to chip and kill C Lizards over time. Examples include CWhale, CTitan and Jameira.
-   **Spammable Attackers** - Any units with good damage output that can deal with Ottas is important to have, as they are a large threat in this stage. AoE is not required, as there are only two Ottas per wave. Some examples include Hip Hop, Paris, Drama and Crazed Gross.
    

  

**Great-to-Have Units**
  

-   **Hacker Cat** - Outranges Crazed Lizard and deals decent chip damage. Make sure you meatshield well since they are quite fragile.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Tankers** - Units such as Hades can be used to deal good damage against Crazed Lizards, being able to to tank as well as deal good DPS.
-   **Kasa Jizo** - A good spammable AoE attacker here for the Ottas.
-   **Rushers** - Similar to Tankers, they can chip at Crazed Lizards, but sacrifice HP for more Damage. Examples include Yukimura and D’arktanyan.
    

  

> ### Lineup and Strategies

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBzPoY50Fa8) - Courtesy of Gardangle

  

Firstly kill the initial Mooths, send out meatshields as well as your AoE attackers, and keep sending them until they all die. Upgrade your wallet to max during this time, as you will need the extra money. Once the Crazed Lizards have spawned, lure them decently close to your base, and then start meatshielding. 

During the Otta waves, send out your AoE attackers as well as your meatshields to kill them. Crazed Whale can be used for both the Otta waves and chipping Crazed Lizards, but other tankers should generally be saved for CLizards alone. 

 If you push too much and CLizards are farther than half of the field, re-lure by spawning not spawning your AoE attackers on the next Otta wave.

## Crazed Titan  
  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Decent Attackers with >320 Range:** Paris, Drama, Dragon, Bath, etc.
-   **Bahamut Cat** - One of the only non-uber Backliners that the player generally has. Due to his high damage per hit, he can one-shot Gory Black and Doge Darks. 
-   **Crazed Cat** - Due to Crazed Titan having decently long foreswing and backswing, he can be stalled easily with one Crazed Cat. Also helps reduce the chance that Crazed Titan waves with its fragility.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Ring Girl Cat / Castaway** - Works very well here to quickly dispose of the Black peons with its Massive Damage to Black ability.
-   **Octopus Cat** - Uncommon amongst players who are trying to beat C. Titan, but helps immensely for those who do with its ability to block waves.
    

  

**Useful Ubers**

  

-   **Generalist Ubers with >320 Range:** Catman, Twinstars, Megidora, etc.  
-   **Wave Immune Attackers with >320 Range:** Li’l Valk, Shishilan Pasalan, Shadow Akira, etc.  
-   **Wave Blocker Ubers:** CMK3, Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2020, etc.
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers:** Snow Miku 2021, Valiant D’arktanyan, Shadow Gao, etc.

- +CPU (optional), Sniper

  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LggIJHDblE4) - Courtesy of Kuruluu

  

Start off the stage by clearing out the initial Squire Rels. When the Gories arrive, keep spamming your meat shield alongside Paris Cat, who should be able to fend off the first few waves of Gories. Build up your wallet as you keep spamming these two units, until you reach max level worker, as well as filling your wallet (around 10000 should be fine) which then you send out Bahamut, and Dragon Cat.

  

During the battle against Crazed Titan, there’s no real strategy other than turning off your CPU when your money runs low. If you aren’t using CPU, then just spam your spammable ranged attackers manually which you should prioritise over sending Bahamut if your money is low, as he tends to miss his attacks quite often. The occasional wave attacks from Crazed Titan are completely random, and can either mess up your run, or not appear at all. Force closing a few times is most likely necessary in order to achieve the RNG needed to win.

  

# Manics

##   Manic Mohawk

  
  

**Must-Have Units**

  
  

-   **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - Similarly to Crazed Cat, Crazed Bahamut is a decent backliner for the stage. His long attack cycle allows him to be stacked at the start, although this might not be possible if you are stacking other units
-   **Some Form of Competent LD / Wave** - With the addition of Master A, Crazed Bahamut can no longer snipe the backliners. The most consistent way to take care of them is through long-distance and wave attacks. Examples include Crazed Gross, Medalist Cat, Housewife Cat, Red Riding Mina, etc.
-   **Spammable Attackers** - Dragon Cat, Crazed Dragon, Drama, Surfer, Ring Girl, Bath or any attacker with over 240 works as damage for Manic Mohawk. Cyborg isn’t recommended as she is a cash drain.
-   **Thaumaturge Cat** - Due to Manic Mohawk having much more pushing power than Crazed Cat, it is important to use CC to subdue him. Thaumaturge and 4 meatshields perfectly stall Manic Mohawk.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Driller Cat** - Driller has a 90% weaken towards traitless, allowing him to control Manic Mohawk with ease. As Driller does not have a 100% uptime, the player needs to stack a couple at the start, before hitting base. Make sure that they are not synced Due to their differing weakens, do not use Thaumaturge and Driller together.
-   **Cyberpunk Cat** - Very useful here to CC MMohawk, able to be stacked to great effect, shown [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd6_l-RT-8k&t=70s) Make sure to desync them and 4-5 are optimal. 
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners)** - The player can replace Crazed Bahamut with any Backliner uber, provided they are levelled (Eg. Masamune, Catman, Thundia, Mekako)
-   **Ubers with Long Distance** - Ubers with LD make dealing with the Master As and Teacher Bears much easier, as they can snipe them from a safe range. (Eg. Ganesha, Yoshimoto, Kaslis)  
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers** - As expected, they perform amazing here (Eg. Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, Black Zeus, D’arktanyan)
    

  

> ### Lineup and Strategies

  

**Medalist Stack Strat**
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XZIe2q5kngiNdBVnydKKV0vxLA-9fTMZeRiVxm2d6VoGBkZwhFijM4iAyPZwactQzbCweMSOmnSin7aWJg2_73rlBlI9qWAov1wF3jQy6E-8CP73dh3y8v4yMJQ60ASBTIZFicZg9y_ZxSHjYA)



-   +Sniper, CPU (Optional)
    

  

[Video](https://youtu.be/jKeRlsjoidw) - Courtesy of Definitely Not Mikka

CPU and Sniper are recommended here to stall the boss efficiently.

At the beginning, lure the weak peons to base and stack Medalist or other stackable LD on them. You can initially stall them with a C. Wall/Eraser, but once you have a good stack, try to rely on base HP. 

Once your base HP is low or you feel like your stack is large enough, turn on CPU. Once boss wave is triggered, use Cannon soon after to let your Medalist stack survive a bit longer. From here, just be wary of your wallet and spam manually should it get too low.

  



  



## Manic Eraser

  

**Must-Have Units**
  

-   **Ururun Wolf** - A rather essential unit here. Apart from working well as a generic Backliner that can chip at Manic Eraser, its fast attack rate and ability to 1HKB the Black Gories at level 30 mean Ururun works especially well here to control the dangerous Black Gories and its chance to KB also allows it to regain ground from Manic Eraser.  
-   **Crazed Bahamut** - One of your few accessible options for a generic Backliner, and can work well enough as one to chip away at MEraser and deal with peons.  
-   **King Dragon/Crazed Dragon** - Works well here as a generic spammable attacker which can outrange the boss, able to chip at the boss and help deal with peons.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units** 
  

-   **Pizza** - Works very well to quickly dispatch the dangerous Gory Black waves. There are alternatives to this role, Seafarer and Drama also working to help dispatch the Gory Black waves, although working less well compared to Pizza.  
-   **Cyberpunk** - Works well here to provide decent CC from a very safe range to control peons and the boss, and can also provide some small chip damage as well.  
-   **Luxury Bath** - Acts similarly to Dragons here, outranging Manic Eraser and able to deal some chip damage towards the boss and deal with peons well, while also having Massive Damage to Red, allowing it to dispatch Capy quickly.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**  
  

-   **Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners):** Catman, Nurse, Megidora, etc.  
-   **Shadow Gao** - Works well here as an above-average Backliner and can nuke the boss with its Massive Damage toward Traitless ability.

- +Sniper, CPU (Optional)

  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OtHkm3tYaY) - Courtesy of Kuruluu  
  
Sniper is very important here as MEraser with its 1KB means it's basically a wall, with no chance to regain back precious space with normal damage KBs. Therefore you need ways to regain back this space, Sniper being one of the few ways to do this.

  

Now onto the actual strategy. For the start off you can just wait and build up your wallet. Eventually, Gory Black will come and you can spam a few meatshields and use Pizza to quickly dispatch them. After this, get Cyberpunk and don’t spawn anything until Owlbrowos appear. Once it does, spam dual Erasers until Capy comes out you can basically spam everything except Pizza.  
  
Once you’ve triggered base, there isn’t much strategy apart from spamming everything, with the exception of Pizza, until MEraser eventually dies, although there are a few things to take into consideration. Pizza should be saved for dealing with the Black Gories waves. Depending on the distance MEraser is from your base, you can usually send out Pizza when Capy comes out so that the 2nd Pizza arrives at the frontline around about when the Black Gories come. Ururun should also NOT be stacked here. If you have 1 Ururun on the field and can spawn another one, do NOT spawn another one. This is because it can end up causing KB to proc too much, and end up in your units clipping into MEraser and dying. Due to this, it’s usually better to just save Ururun until the current one on the field is dead.

## Manic Dark

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Cameraman Cat** - An excellent spammable attacker for dealing with both JK Bun Bun and Shy Boy with its cost efficiency and Strong vs Floating ability.
-   **Sanzo Cat** - Helpful here for its ability to shut down JK Bun Buns and Shy Boys pushing power.
-   **Awakened Bahamut Cat (Without Rich Cat)** - When Shy Boys are being slowed by Sanzo near the outside of Manic Dark’s range, Awakened Bahamut is key to kill these Shy Boys as fast as possible, giving you money to ease the money-tight start-off without a Rich Cat item.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Can Can (With Double Bounty Talent)** - Can Can Cat is very useful for sniping Sir Seals with double bounty, especially useful for the money-tight start off. Can Can can also dish out some nice supplementary DPS and CC against the Shy Boys and JK Bun Bun as well.
-   **King Dragon/Crazed Dragon Cat(s)** - Dragons provide good and stackable damage that substantially outranges all enemies (besides Nyandam) in this stage.
-   **Luxury Bath Cat** - Luxury Bath Cat performs similarly to King Dragon/Crazed Dragon, but also provides 4x the damage against the Shy Boys and J.K Bun Bun.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Floating/Red Nukers:** B.C.S Lionheart, Divine Windy, Catman, etc. 
-   **Epicfest Exclusives:** Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, Dark’tanyan, etc.

> **Note:** You may have noticed that the levels for this run are rather high. This is due to the fact that MDark will usually be your last manic done due to its high difficulty and also rather useless drop.

  

Rich and CPU are reccomended because the lack of beginning cash and how much you'll be spamming. Sniper can also be useful for cleanup. 
 
Start immediately spamming dual Erasers to stall, then spawn 1 Sanzo and 1 Can Can to kill the Seal. Once you kill the Seal, Shy Boys will shortly come after, start spamming everything except your Backliners. Once you gain cash from killing Shy Boys, spawn Bahamut. 

Shortly after, J.K Bun Bun will spawn. Turn on CPU and watch the fight until J.K. Bun Bun dies. Be wary of your wallet and turn off CPU and spam manually if it gets too low. 

After J.K. Bun Bun dies, turn off CPU and slowly chip MDark. This is an tedious and long part, but spawning Can Can for Seals and cycling backliners is key.


## Manic Macho Legs

  

**Must-Have Units**  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - An essential unit if you don’t have Octopus. Its incredibly high DPS makes it valuable for juggling and quickly killing the MML before they can stack up.  
-   **Spammable Ranged Attackers:** Dual Dragons, Cyborg, Drama, Macho Legs, etc.  
-   **Vendor Cat** - Another essential unit here if you don’t have Octopus. Its ability to frequently KB and shortly freeze Traitless enemies proving very useful here to juggle MML here. [Possible without Vendor and Octo but requires a much larger boost for attackers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEd8ZQuMo8o)
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Octopus Cat** - Practically breaks the stage if you do own him. Spamming a few meatshields, Octopus, some spammable ranged attackers and A. Baha (if you have it) lead to an easy win.  
      
    

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Epicfest Exclusives:** Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, Valiant D’arktanyan, etc.  
-   **Wave Immune Ubers:** Shishilan, Immortal Keiji, Li’l Valk, etc.  
-   **Wave Blocker Ubers:** CMK3, Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2020, etc.

> **Note:** the strategy can be inconsistent, with many things that can possibly go wrong, seemingly for no reason. This consistency increases and decreases depending on your unit levels, with this strategy being executable with lower levels like Lv20 C. Dragon, however just being more inconsistent.
  
Both Rich and Sniper are rather important. With the amount of attackers you’re spamming, you need Rich and Sniper can help give you a bit more time to juggle the MMLs. Cool Japan can also be replaced by any other attack combo if you don’t have it. Now onto the main strategy.

  
At the beginning, lure the first MML near your base. From here there’s a few different ways to execute the start off (when you first spawn your attackers, when you spawn A. Baha and when you spawn Vendor), but following the video in question the setup is simple. Wait until around 10500c before spawning a single Cyborg, let it be attacked by the first MML before then quickly spawning Vendor and other spammable attackers after the wave has passed the base. After Vendor hits MML, immediately spawn A. Bahamut. From here, just spam your spammable ranged attackers until your victory.

Spam meatshields, Octopus, Awakened Bahamut, win.

## Manic Lion

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Your main damage dealers in the fight. Any decent attacker works. There is not much concern for cost, and your priority should be spammability and raw DPS. Examples include Cameraman Cat, Drama Cat, Crazed U.F.O, Chill Cat, Cyborg Cat and many more.
-   **Awakened Bahamut Cat** - Awakened Bahamut has the highest non-uber DPS in the game, and provided he is protected well, he can dish out huge amounts of damage to the Manic Lion horde.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Holy Valkyrie Cat** - Works for her Freeze, which can provide some breathing space against the Lion horde, although can be inconsistent.
-   **Healer Cat CC** - Useful here similar to Valk, being much more consistent with 100% proc, but a bit more risky with its lower range and non-existent HP.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Kasa Jizo** - Performs well as a good spammable attacker here.
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers** - As expected, they do very well here (Eg. D’arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, Black Zeus, Snow Miku.
-   **Any Uber with High AoE DPS** - More damage for the Manic Lions. Preferably has short foreswing and high damage per hit (Eg. Li’l Valk, Kalisa, Cradle, etc. )

-   +Rich, CPU
    

  

[Video](https://youtu.be/4IeEbNLTkkc) - Courtesy of Not Mikka

  

CPU and Rich are reccomended as you'll be spamming alot of units in the stage. 

First off, spawn one Crazed UFO and start spamming 3 of your meatshields until the first Manic Lion is dead. After the first Manic Lion dies, let your cats reach and attack the base. After triggering the base, the next thing to do is to lure them around 3/4 of the field (adjustable depending on your own experience). 

After that, spam everything except Bahamut. When HValk gets a freeze, turn on CPU. If Awakened Bahamut gets out good hits, you should be fine to win. 

There can be some stuff that can go wrong and make it a bit inconsistent. For example, Holy Valkyrie not getting the necessary freeze or Awakened Bahamut will get hit by synced Manic Lions and get 1 shot, but this is sadly RNG-dependent so all you can do is retry.

## Manic Flying  
  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Works very well here to rush down and chip at Manic Flying and can also be used to chain and quickly dispose of Rain Ds. 
-   **iCat** - Works well here as a consistent means to control the Bores that spawn with its guaranteed freeze with a decent uptime. Alternatives exist to deal with Bore, although perform considerably worse. Examples include Roe, Cancan and Enchantress.  
-   **Seafarer** - Very useful here for its ability to consistently control the Nimroy Bores with a mostly consistent freeze proc while also having decent DPS to work as an attacker. Alternatives exist, although perform considerably worse. Examples include Corrupted Psychocat.  
-   **Cyborg** - Works as a ranged attacker that can help to dispatch the Rain Ds, other alternatives like King Dragon and Drama also work similarly.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Cyberpunk** - Long ranged CC which can provide decent control over everything from a comfortably safe distance and can deal some small chip damage to the boss.  
-   **Fishman** - A good anti-Floating Rusher who can deal good chip damage towards MFlying when it’s alone.  
-   **Sadako** - Useful here for its ability to weaken MFlying, able to weaken it and make your other means of chipping at MFlying (Abaha, Fishman) survive longer and do more damage when MFlying is alone, speeding up the process of chipping at and killing MFlying.  
-   **Cancan** - Useful for its good damage output against both Bores and can chip at MFlying. Slow proc can also be nice as well here. Notably, at level 38 and Speed Up talents, it can reliably hit Rain D, making killing Rain D much quicker and easier.  
-   **Sniper the Recruit** - Useful here with its high range and guaranteed chance to KB, able to KB MFlying from a safe distance, regaining lost ground from MFlying and the peons.  
      
    

**Useful Uber Rare Units**  
  

-   **Lufalan Pasalan** - Outranges MFlying here and with a lack of peons spammed here, Lufalan can fully utilise his massive DPS to nuke the peons and deal great damage to the boss.  
-   **Ultima Galaxy Cosmos** - Acts similarly to Sniper the Recruit, although it also has the added benefit of having some chip damage to boot and if TF’d has long freeze duration in which you can rush down MFlying.  
-   **Rushers** - Generic Rushers can benefit your lineup in a similar manner to A. Bahamut.  
-   **Greater Balrog** - Very nice here for its ability to do massive amounts of damage toward everything here.

At the beginning of the stage, lure MFlying and lure Rain. D to the base. Then, chain it with Awakened Bahamut as shown in the video. After Rain D dies, stall MFlying with CCat and spawn Cyberpunk. Now what you do after this point depends on the enemies on the field. 

If MFlying is alone, you can spam CCat to preserve money and occasionally time in Fishman for some damage. If MFlying is with Rain. D, you can spam CCat and CWall and spawn Cyborg occasionally to deal some chip damage to the Rain Ds. If 2 or more Rain Ds stack up with MFlying, you can lure them and chain them with Bahamut. 

For the Bores, spam all your meatshields alongside Cancan, Castaway and your anti-Alien/Red depending on the Bore to dispatch it. You can spawn Cyborg here to deal some chip damage, make sure not to spam too much or else you’ll drain cash. 

Spawn Cyberpunk whenever possible and try to desync them if you can as two or three well desynced Cyberpunks make the stage much easier.

Repeat this cycle until you win.

## Manic Island

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Dread Pirate Catley** - A core unit for the strat provided. Catley provides useful here by preventing Beserkory from attacking, with a decent stack able to juggle Beserkory and not allow it to unleash any of its devastating wave attacks.  
-   **Spammable Attackers with >260 Range:** Cyborg, Drama, Dual Dragons, etc. 
-   **Crazed Bahamut** - Works well enough as a generic Backliner and is one of few accessible options in the role, able to nuke the groups of enemies with his large damage per hit from a relatively safe range.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Luxury Bath Cat** - Works well as a spammable attacker here, performing similarly to Dragon Cat. However it also has the added bonus of Massive Damage towards Red, particularly useful for quickly killing Berserkory here.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Ranged Wave Blockers:** Tokyo Miku 2020 CC, Eva-00, etc.  
-   **Anti-Red Nukers:** Thundia, Pai-Pai, Eva 02, etc.  
-   **High-DPS Mid-rangers:** Li’l Valk, Divine Kalisa, etc.  
-   **Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners):** Catman, Nurse, etc.  
-   **Epicfest Exclusives:** Dark’tanyan, Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, etc.  
-   **Kasa Jizo** - Works basically as a better version of Cyborg/Drama Cats.

Now onto the actual strategy. At the beginning, you can use a few spammable attackers to clear out the Crocos and gain some quick money. Once the first Manic Island begins to arrive, begin to spam meatshields and start stacking up your spammable ranged attackers on it, and continue to stack up spammable ranged attackers on the next waves. Past the start off and as you push forward, begin to stack up Catleys.

  

As you get close to the base, stop your meatshielding. Assuming you’ve built up a decent stack up to this point, you can mostly just spam until you’ve won. Once Beserkory is dead, your win is practically secured, and you can begin spamming meatshields again, although be careful of the dangerous Brollow wave which can appear after the Beserkory is dead if you use this strat.

## Manic King Dragon

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - To rush down the Manic King Dragons and deal a huge amount of damage to them.  
-   **Spammable Attackers:** Camera, Pizza, C. UFO, Can-can, Seafarer, etc. Used to take down the Otta-smack-u waves.    
-   **Fishman** - Mainly for the starting Mooths, Fishman makes dealing with them much easier.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**
-   **Cyberpunk Cat** - Chips down the Manic King Dragons, as well as bonus Crowd Control and can kill some of the weaker peons like the Snaches and Crocos.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Kasa Jizo** - A good spammable attacker, like the other spammable attackers it's used to take down the Otta-smack-u waves.
-  **Tankers** - Examples include Dark Beastlord Garu, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Keiji, etc. They are used to tank and deal out heavy damage to the Manic King Dragons as well as do very good damage to the Otta-smack-u waves.  
-   **Rushers** - Examples include Immortal Yukimura, Valiant D'arktanyan, Legeluga, etc. These can be used in a similar manner to Awakened Bahamut, used to rush down and chip at the bosses.
-   **Super Galaxy Cosmo** - Like Cyberpunk, it can be used to chip down the Manic King Dragons.
-   **Balalan Pasalan** - His very long range and freeze ability can be useful to give Awakened Bahamut an easier time to take down the Manic King Dragons, as well as give some breathing time from dealing with the Otta-smack-u waves.
    

  
  

**Lineup and Strategy**

[Video](https://youtu.be/xC8aJq4Blog)  - Courtesy of Not Mikka

  
For the start off, lure the Mooths and use Cancan and Fishman to kill them quickly, also getting out Cyberpunk when you can.
 
When the Ottas come, spam all your meatshields and your spammable attackers to quickly kill them. Try to spawn only 2-4 CUFOs though to conserve cash. 

When MKDs are alone, spam MEraser and spawn Cyberpunk whenever possible (and Tankers if you bring them). Save up Bahamut to rush down MKDs, preferably doing so when they’re synced or nearly synced to make timing easier. If they’re desynced, wait for them to push up a bit and use Cat Cannon to sync them. You can use TBolt to freeze the MKDs and time Bahamut, but that requires at least level 4 TBolt. 

This repeats until you kill the MKDs. Do keep in mind that there are 6 extra MKDs in base and if you mess up destroying base you may have to deal with the stage all over again.

  

## Manic Jamiera

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-  **Octopus Cat** - The main core unit which this strategy focuses around, with its ability to block waves being incredibly helpful here.
-   **Decent Attackers with >320 Range:** Drama, Dual Dragons, Cyborg, etc.
    

  

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Pizza / Seafarer** - While outranged, both can work well to help quickly dispatch of the troublesome peons here, although I generally prefer Pizza here if you have both.
-   **Vendor** - Despite being outranged by MJam, Vendor can work well to land a few hits off on MJam to push back and gain back ground from MJam.
-   **Ururun** - Not only works well as a ranged attacker to chip at MJam and deal with peons but also has a chance to KB which can be nice to push back the boss and gain back some ground.
    

  

**Useful Uber Rare Units**

  

-   **Wave Immune Ubers with >320 Range:** Shishilan, Li’l Valk, etc.
-   **Wave Blocker Ubers:** Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2021, CMK3, etc.
-   **Epicfest Exclusives:** Valiant D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, etc.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByA0kKhmp7w) - Courtesy of LucasIV  
  
> **Note:** If you lack Octopus, you can replace BioBone and Octopus for more ranged attackers or other units that can work well here. However unless you have ubers that are hard carries, the stage will become much more RNG-reliant and generally harder without Octopus.

  

At the beginning you can stall for money by killing the peons with a few attackers and then letting those attackers be killed, luring and repeating this until you have a max wallet and near full cash. Once you have max cash you can just pretty much spam your ranged attackers, MS and Octo throughout until you win and save Pizza (or Seafarer) to quickly dispatch of the troublesome peons.

  

On an extra note, if you do elect to bring particularly money-drainy units like Cyborg, be wary of how much cash you have and to restrict or stop spamming your attackers should your cash go too low.

  

# Li’ls

  

## Li’l Mohawk

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crimson Mina** - An LD attacker, which is needed to kill the Professor A’s in this stage. She can however be replaced by Prisoner Cat (TF required) if you do not own her.  
-   **Thaumaturge** - With the high pushing power of Li’l Mohawk, Thaumaturge is essential here for controlling it.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Zamboney** - Makes stalling at the start much easier.  
-   **Prisoner** - Great here for its ability to snipe Professor A and be stacked at the start for extra effectiveness.  
-   **Cat God** - Can be used here to effectively cheese the level by abusing Omni mechanics.

- +Sniper, CPU 

  

[Video](https://youtu.be/8c8Be_k8snQ) - Courtesy of Definitey Not Mikka  
  
Sniper is nice here for stalling Li’l Mohawk and stalling at the start. CPU allows for much better stalling of the boss as well  
  
Relatively straightforward with a few things to note. Lure peons and stall them close to base while you stack Mina or Prisoner if you have it. When you only have 1-2, try keeping 2 out at the same time, but when you have more, just keep 1 out and rely a bit on base HP. If there are too many on base you can try to use Sniper to pick some off. If there’s only 1 Snache on base and you have multiple desynced Minas, you can also try to rely on base HP only.  
  
After stacking as many Minas as possible, preferably around 5 or more if you can manage it, push forward and approach base and then turn on CPU and Sniper until you win or lose.

##   Li’l Eraser

  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Crazed Bahamut/Ururun** - Your main damage dealers for the peons and Li’l Eraser. Able to outrange and deal some decent DPS, and Ururun’s KB is also quite useful here.  
-   **Cyborg** - Able to help to quickly dispose of the Dagshunds and Black Gories.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Vendor** - Able to tank a hit from Li’l Eraser and push back Li’l Eraser. Great for regaining lost space.  
-   **Prisoner/LKD** - Both are among the few able to outrange Li’l Eraser and deal some decent chip damage.  
-   **Cat God** - By abusing Omni-mechanics he can outrange Li’l Eraser and continuously push it back, denying it the ability to meaningfully push.  
-   **Mina/Li’l Nyandam** - Only use if you’re desperate and have nothing better to put into your spare slots. While their DPS is rather poor, they outrange and are better than nothing.

- +Sniper 

  

[Video](https://youtu.be/tSJt_xFrxps) - Courtesy of Definitely Not Mikka

  

Begin the stage by stalling for money. Keep Sniper on to deal with the Sir Rels at the start and spawn a Jiangshi if they hit base. Upgrade your wallet to Level 6 and wait. Once the Black Gory comes out, lure to base, spam a few meatshields and kill it with C Bahamut. Let C Bahamut push up a bit through Sniper and let it be killed by Squire Rels. Once the Owlbrowos come, stall it by spamming a few meatshields. Once Dagshund comes, spam everything except Cyborg and Tourist.

  

Once you hit base, you only need to basically spam meatshields and remember a few key things. Try to spawn Vendor when Li’l Eraser is alone and not at base. Spam Cyborg when Dagshunds and Black Gories come out. And as a final note, try not to have 2 Ururuns at the same time as to mitigate the chances of clipping on base and dying.

##   Li’l Dark  
  

**Must-Have Units**

  

-   **Ramen** - Excellent here for its ability to stall out the Angel peons and also the boss at the same time, especially when paired with Research combos.  
-   **Camera/Cyborg** - Works well here to quickly dispatch the Angel peons.  
-   **Crazed Bahamut** - One of few accessible options to be able to outrange Li’l Dark and put out decent damage. (Ururun is counterproductive here due to her KB)  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Li’l Nyandam/Mina/Musashi/Prisoner/Li’l King Dragon** - Basically your options for units which can outrange and deal some chip damage at the least.

[Video](https://youtu.be/XpxjNbZJ_-E) - Courtesy of Definitely Not Mikka  
  
Incredibly straightforward. Lure Li’l Dark a bit before then spamming Ramen and getting out Crazed Bahamut. Use Camera whenever Angelic peons like Heavenly Hippoe come.

  

As an extra note, try not to stack Crazed Bahamut and spawn it when the other one dies. Otherwise it’s straightforward and easy.

##   Li’l Macho Legs

  
**Must-Have Unit**s  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - With the ability to output more than 100k Damage (with attack combos) and juggle the boss, he is one of the main reasons this level is such a cakewalk.  
-   **Any Attack Combo** - Allows Awakened Bahamut to knockback the boss in one hit and juggle them.

If you lack any attack combo, add spammable ranged attackers like Cyborg, and ones preferably with speed to deal a little bit of chip damage to make sure you can juggle the Li’l Macho Legs. Otherwise you can quite literally spawn A. Bahamut w/ an attack combo here for a free win.

  

## Li’l Lion

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Very helpful here to quickly rush down and kill the Li’l Lions.  
-   **Cameraman/Chill/Cyborg** - Main sources of damage to kill and control the Li’l Lions. You can use all three if you remove BioBone or mainly Camera if you use BioBone.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **TeacherBear Cat** - Incredibly useful here if you have it for shredding Li’l Lions.  
-   **BioBone** - Very useful here as it can increase the spammability of Ramen and Camera, although sacrifices 3 slots here that could be used for Cyborg/Chill and other units.  
-   **Holy Valkyrie** - Can work here to CC the Li’l Lions and give some breathing room against the hard-pushing Li’l Lion horde.

Rich can help here, although it isn't needed. It helps a lot if you’re replacing BioBone with other units like Cyborg/Chill. CPU only works if you remove BioBone for other units, but can be nice if you aren’t using BioBone.

Pretty straightforward. Stall at the start with Jiangshi and Ramen + Camera to build up the wallet a bit. Awakened Bahamut can also be used to stall if the beginning Li’l Lions are too much, although try to use it somewhat earlier as to get it off cooldown once you hit base.  
  
Once you hit base, keep spamming Ramen and Camera until you get rather close to base, then spam everything excluding combo units, delaying A. Bahamut spawn a bit until the frontline stabilises. You can even spam combo units to stall if you have enough cash and are desperate, although don’t overdo it and keep an eye on your wallet.  
  

Keep spamming until the spam of Li’l Lions has died down, meaning you’ve basically won.  
  

##   Li’l Flying

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Works nicely here to chip at Li’l Flying and dispose of Rain Ds quickly.  
-   **Elemental Duelist** - Needed here to quickly dispose of Onehorns for cash.  
-   **Cyborg** - Useful to help deal with both Rain Ds and Owlbrowos.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Slime** - Very helpful here, able to chip at Li’l Flying and do large amounts of damage to really everything in this level with some timing or a stepping stone.  
-   **Cat God/HeALER** - Both provide viable cheese methods. Shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hofhv-iL4M) and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4gYYrTXOBU&t=106s)
-   **Cataur** - Helpful here to quickly dispose of the Owlbrowos, with Massive Damage to Floating and even LD to kill Owlbrowo even if it hides behind another enemy, which it frequently does.  
-   **Enchantress/Gentleman Bros** - Helps mitigate how much the One Horn can push and keep your EDuelist stack alive.  
-   **Doctor** - Can be timed in when Li’l Flying is alone to regain some much needed space.  
-   **Ramen** - Can work nicely here to stall enemies, especially when paired with BioBone, working as a sole meatshield.

Sniper here is nice for regaining back ground from Li’l Flying, and is one of your few methods of doing so. Breakerblast is also nice here for the same purpose, if you have it unlocked.

  

At the beginning of the stage, lure Li’l Flying and wait for Rain D to spawn. Once it does, lure that to base and then chain it with Awakened Bahamut as shown in the video. After this, stall Li’l Flying with Jiangshi while upgrading the wallet and wait for the other enemies to come. Now what you do is determined by what enemies are on the field.  
  
If Li’l Flying is alone, you can stall it with Jiangshi alone and try to time in Doctors to regain back space.  
  
If Rain D is there as well, spawn occasional Cyborgs to chip at Rain D. You also have the option of timing in Awakened Bahamut to kill it, which is preferable. If Owlbrowo is there, you can also spam Cataur along with Cyborg and spam Li’l Eraser as well.  
  
If One Horn is there at the frontline. Spam both Jiangshi and Li’l Eraser, along with Elemental Duelist and what anti-Red CC you have, and if Rain D is there, Cyborg as well to a limited degree.

  

Cycle this pattern until Li’l Flying dies, meaning you’ve won.  
  

##   Li’l Island

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Crazed Bahamut/Ururun** - Helpful to deal with the Li’l Island hordes as generic backliners.  
-   **Cyborg** - Your main source of damage for clearing the Li’l Islands.  
-   **Space/Catasaurus** - Your main source of damage for killing the Super Metal Hippoe.   
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**  
  

-   **Research/Attack Combos** - Both “Tiny Ancient Hunt” and “Mini-Saurus” can work to good effect here. “Tiny Ancient Hunt” has Jiangshi which can be used as a meatshield here, making it effectively only take 1 slot and can help Cyborg and your critters. “Mini-saurus” can also help by making Ramen more spammable, taking effectively no slots as both units in the combo are useful here.  
-   **Hoopmaster/Puppetmaster** - Can be helpful here to CC the SMH and control its hard pushing power.

> Note: This strategy can be rather inconsistent due to the very nature of Metals, so you may need to try multiple times.  As an extra note, 32 Li’l Eraser and 39 Jiangshi both allow each one to survive an extra hit from Li’l Island, which can be helpful.  
  
Rich is nice here for the start off as it can be tight money wise.  
  
Rather self explanatory by the video but lets run down through it. First stall at the start with Cyborg and a few meatshields until you can get Ururun out. Then proceed to stack a few more Cyborgs and get C. Bahamut out. Continue stacking until you reach base, spamming Space as you get close to it. As an extra note here, try not to spam too many Cyborgs at the start as to not push too hard and to stall for more money.

  

Once you hit base start spamming Catasaurus and now it’s simply spam and pray RNG means you can kill SMH quickly.  
  
As some final notes, be wary of your cat limit and money here. As you approach base you may start to spam only a couple of meatshields (only if Li’l Islands aren’t there) and if your money starts running low, stop spamming too much and prioritise.

##   Li’l King Dragon

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Essential here and is your main source of damage for killing the Li’l King Dragons.  
-   **Dancer** [ Untalented Still Works ]/Camera/Cyborg - Any 2/all 3 work here, helpful for taking out the troublesome Gabriel/Doge Dark.  
-   **Speedup/Attack Combos** - You really have an array of combos to work with here. Attack can help for killing Dragons/peons quicker. Speed-up can help with timing in A. Bahamut and let him land hits more consistently or even hit extra hits. Even Research combos can help with a high levelled Ramen.
    

  
**Great-To-Have Units**
  

-   **Slime** - Very nice here if you do have it. Can quickly delete the Doges and chip at Li’l King Dragon with the long reach of its wave attack. However if you use Slime here, don’t use Ramen with it.  
-   **Ramen** [~Lv 45/+ Recommended ] - A double-edged sword here, only really recommended at high levels like around level 50 or above. It can help stall nicely as a meatshield here and can even hit and chip at Dragons at higher levels, however it can prolong how long the Doges stay on the field by continuously KB’ing them, with bad synergy with Cyborg. If you also use Ramen, it is generally recommended to use BioBone or other research substitutes.

At the beginning of the stage, lure the first Dragon and the Doges close to your base before spamming meatshields and your spammable attackers to deal with the wave of Gabriels and Doge Darks. Once the second Dragon comes, assuming you’ve cleared the rest of the Doges, lure the Dragons to base to sync them up and follow the timing shown in the video to chain them.  
  
After this, just repeat in a similar fashion until Dragons stop spawning. Using your spammable attackers to deal with the peons and timing A. Bahamut in to rush them down when the path is clear of Doges, generally trying to time it in when Dragons are synced as to make your life easier, which can happen naturally over time or you can lure a bit.

##   Li’l Jamiera

  

**Must-Have Units**  
  

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Your main source of damage against Li’l Jamiera and can be nice to quickly kill Gory.  
-   **Riceball/Ramen** - Good meatshields here. Riceball for stalling Li’l Jam and Ramen for Gory. As an extra note, you want a Level 33 Riceball w/ defence combo or a Level 37 Riceball without one to make stalling Li’l Jam much easier.  
-   **Dancer/Cyborg** - Useful for quickly killing Gory here.  
      
    

**Great-To-Have Units**

  

-   **Talented Dancer** - Practically makes this stage a joke if talented. Shreds Gories and Li’l Jam.  
-   **Musashi** - Can be nice for speeding up the stage if you have it.
-   **Vendor/Macho Crystal Cat** - Very useful here. Able to tank Jamiera hits/waves and push it back.

Very straightforward strategy but I’ll give a short summary here. Lure at the beginning and stall for money by using Cyborg/Dancer. Upon base hit, lure again. Then stall with Ramen and timing Cyborg/Dancer for Gories. Riceball can help stall when the field is clear or Li'l Jam is too close, but be wary of cash using it. Use Tourist whenever the field is clear and Bahamut can be used here to chip at Li’l Jam or save it to kill Gory quickly.
