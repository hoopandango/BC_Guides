 You may notice that as you go through the guides you may not have the exact levels that a guide specifies or may be missing a unit from the recommended lineup. While guidemakers do try to accommodate for the most people when making their guides, it is not uncommon to miss an essential gacha unit that is in lineup or for guides to have overlevelled normals or Manics and yours aren’t quite that high.
 
If a guide has a Level 35 Octopus and yours is only 30, it is common sense to understand that 30 is most likely sufficient, unless stated otherwise. Of course the levels required are rather fluid and can depend on your units, lower levels usually being compensated by other means like ubers. 

If you lack a gacha unit from the recommended lineup, while not a good sign, doesn’t always mean that you are unable to win with said strat. There are many alternatives listed and/or ubers that can most likely compensate. In general, however, you don’t need to follow a recommended lineup 1 to 1. 

We try to make the lineups shown as accessible as possible, and such some lineups may have missing slots, but if you have something that works well here, fill in those slots. Try to adapt a recommended lineup around your levels and units. If you think you have a good uber or better alternative for something in a recommended lineup, go for it.
