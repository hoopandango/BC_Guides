### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Whale Cat** - Absolutely carries this stage with good HP and damage. He is able to chip down both Rain D. and Crazed Bird, as well as having Strong vs Red, making him very useful for the Bore waves.
- **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - A solid backliner only sent out during Bore and Shy Boy waves, and will also deal damage to Rain Ds during those waves.
- **Spammable Ranged Attackers** - Units such as Paris, Dragon, Crazed Lizard, etc. can help by supporting Bahamut during the Bore phases and can also work for the Rain D phases.
 
### Great-To-Have Units
- **Swimmer Cat** - Has Massive DMG vs Floating as well as good speed, allowing him to chip Crazed Bird consistently, speeding up the process. Can also be used during the Bore and Shy Boy waves.
- **Kotatsu Cat** - Has Resistant vs Floating as well as 50% chance to weaken Crazed Bird, allowing your Crazed Whales to chip more consistently as they can tank for longer. Do not send this unit during Bore waves as they will die fast.
- **Hip Hop Cat** - Works to chip Crazed Bird if no Rain Ds are alive, and works on the Bore phase as well, having a 40% chance to slow him and deal good damage.
- **Sniper the Recruit** - Able to outrange CBird, as well as having a 100% chance to KB, allowing you to gain back ground from Crazed Bird.
- **Other Anti-Red Units** - Units such as Swordsman Cat, Bath Cat, Sushi Cat, can all work against the Bores, making them much easier to deal with.
 
### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Backliner Ubers** - Ubers with decent range can be a good replacement for Bahamut during Bore waves, allowing you to keep more ground. A good example is Thundia.
- **Rusher Ubers** - Ubers such as D’arktanyan or Yukimura who have high speeds can be used to rush down Crazed Bird, dealing a good amount of damage.
- **Tanker Ubers** - High-HP Ubers such as Hades will be able to tank Crazed Bird and Rain Ds, as well as dealing good damage.
- **Super Galaxy Cosmo** - Acts similarly to Sniper the Recruit, outranging the boss, as well as having decent chip damage, and a 100% chance to KB Crazed Bird. Very valuable to have in this stage.

Sniper is useful since Crazed Bird only has 1 KB, allowing you a method of pushing him back to gain back ground other than the Cat Cannon.

The main strategies consist of cycling units for each enemy. Use units which can chip at CBird (CWhale in this lineup) when CBird is alone. When Rain D is out, use your spammable attackers (CWhale in this lineup). When Bore comes out, send out Bahamut, your ranged attackers and meatshields along with any anti-Red units you’ve brought. 

Should Shy Boy appear, spam meatshields along with any anti-Red you’ve brought. Repeat this cycle until CBird is dead, meaning you’ve basically won.
