### Must-Have Units
- **Decent Tankers** - Core units for the tanker strategy. Examples include CTitan, CWhale, Island and Jameira. 
- **Decent Spammable Ranged Attackers** - Helps for the ranged stack strat to make juggling CGross easier. Examples include Paris, Dragon Cat, Drama Cats, Macho Legs Cat and Crazed Dragon Cat.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Octopus Cat** - Practically breaks the stage if you do own him. Spamming a few meatshields, Octopus, some spammable ranged attackers leads to an easy win.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Tankers** - Examples include Dark Beastlord Garu, Cat Machine, Guardian Gamereon, etc. for the Tanker strat, like Crazed Titan and the other units you're bringing, they tank hits and dish out damage.
- **Kasa Jizo** - For the ranged stack strat, acts the same as most ranged attackers you're bringing, but better.
- **Anti-Wave Ubers** - Examples include Shadow Akira, Epicfest exclusive Ubers, Hell Sentinel Emma, Anubis the Unblemished, etc. As they can ignore the waves from Crazed Gross (Cat Machine and Hell Sentinel Emma blocking the waves) they can deal damage while also being unharmed.

Cool Japan combo is very helpful here but if you don't have it, you can use a Defense Up with extra attackers or another Attack Up combo. Rich is necessary for spamming and Sniper helps also. 

Very straightforward. Lure the first Crazed Gross around midfield, before then basically spamming Paris and Dragon (and any other ranged attackers you bring) until your victory.

Fisherman is here for the Moby Dick defence combo. Defence combos are rather helpful here as they allow your units to tank more of CGrossâ€™s hits. If you lack Moby Dick specifically, other defence combos can suffice. If you lack any, your best bet is hoping your extra levels, units or ubers may make up for the lack of one. Now onto the main strategy.

Also very straightforward. Lure the first Crazed Gross around midfield, then spam Whale, CTitan and CWhale (or any other Tankers/Wave Immune attackers you bring) until your victory.
