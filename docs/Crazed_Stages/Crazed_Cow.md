### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - A backliner that deals a hefty amount of damage to deal with the CCow hordes, practically essential for this stage. Can nearly ohkb a stack of Crazed Cows at level 20.
- **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Spammable AoE attackers are essential for this stage to deal extra damage to control the CCow hordes in between Bahamut’s attack cycles. Examples include Cameraman, Paris, Castaway, UFO, etc.
 
### Great-To-Have Units
- **Valkyrie Cat** - If you have absolutely no other options such as the lineup below, Valkyrie Cat is an option as another damage dealer.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Most first form Ultra Souls ubers such as Kasa Jizo should work here, performing similarly to Paris. 
- **Generic Backliners** - Most ubers with better stats than C. Bahamut can serve as an upgrade, improving consistency. Examples include Catman, Nurse, Vars, etc.
- **Anti-Traitless Ubers** - Epicfest Exclusives such as Shadow Gao or D’arktanyan perform excellently in this stage due to their anti-Traitless abilities or just raw stats.

CPU is necessary to bring to this stage for effective spamming, but do be wary of draining cash. It's also reccomended to not use UFO and Paris together as they will drain cash. Rich also helps for the start off. 

At the start, send a few meatshields to kill Bunnies and level your wallet as much as possible. When the first CCow appears, send out a single Paris Cat along with meatshields to try to stall CCow and start maxing out your wallet.

Once the Crazed Cow is dead, stop sending units and wait for the horde to spawn. Then, lure the horde to around halfway, and then turn on CPU and watch the stage. Make sure to be wary of your wallet and spam manually if your wallet is too low.

Eventually the Crazed Cow flow should slow down meaning you've effectively won.
