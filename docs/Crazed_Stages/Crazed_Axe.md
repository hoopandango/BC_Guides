### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - One of your few accessible Backliner options which can outrange C. Axe and chip at it and also help deal with peons.
- **Sanzo Cat** - Aside from the boss himself, the Shy Boys are the other big threat. Sanzo brings them down to a manageable level by slowing them.  
- **Spammable Attackers** - Useful for dealing with Shy Boys quickly before they can stack up and push too hard. Examples include Cameraman, Elemental Duelist and Paris.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Sexy Bathtub Cat** - With Massive Damage to Red enemies, it can do alot of damage to the Shy Boys as well as do some damage to Crazed Axe due to outranging it.
- **Ururun Wolf** - Another decent damager that outranges Crazed Axe. Comes with the ability to push him back at a small rate, which can be helpful if you’re struggling to keep him off your base.  

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Anti-Red/Floating Nukers** - Able to dish out massive damage to the Shy Boys and do some chip to CAxe as well. Examples include Catman, Pai-Pai, B.C.S Tigerclaw, etc.

Start the stage by luring Crazed Axe at least half way across the field. Then, stall him using Crazed Tanks. You should be able to build up a decent amount of money before the Sir Seals arrive, which by then you use all your meatshields as well as Cameraman. Once the first Shy Boy arrives, turn on your CPU. This stage is decently boost-to-win, with spamming your units being the main strategy. If you ever run low on money (which should not be a problem in this stage), remember to turn off the CPU. Once Crazed Axe has died, it should mostly be a free win.
  
It should be noted if you are using Paris or Elemental Duelist, it’s generally not recommended to use CPU due to how much money each can drain if CPU is left on.
