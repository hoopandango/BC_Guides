### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut** - Works well as a ranged attacker for chipping at the boss and dealing with the Le’boins and Teacher Bears. Its uniquely long attack cycle also allows it to be stacked to great effect here, unlike other backliner alternatives.
- **A Fourth Cheap Meatshield:** Awa-dori Cat, Catburger, Coin Cat, Li’l Cat, etc.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Castaway / Paris / Drama** - Any decent attacker with >240 range works, really, but these are the most notable of the bunch which are accessible. If you do opt to use Paris, however, you cannot use CPU.
- **Vaulter / Medalist** - Any decent LD attacker with >240 range also works well here, but these are the most notable of the bunch which are accessible. Having LD is quite notable here however as it allows you to reliably snipe the peons that hide behind the boss.
- **Omnyoji** - Useful here for its ability to let Wall tank 2 hits, making stalling much easier against the boss.
- **Driller** - Can be used similarly to Omnyoji, although Driller’s lower uptime and blindspot means it must be stacked at the beginning to utilise its full effectiveness. However, due to weakening to 10% power compared to Omnyoji’s weakening to 50% power, Driller is much more oppressive on this stage when used effectively.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
-   **Anti-Traitless Ubers:** Snow Miku 2021, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, etc.  
-   **Generic Backliner Ubers:** B.C.S Lionheart, Catman, Rock Revengers, etc.

Sniper and CPU are reccomended here to stall the boss efficiently. 

At the beginning of the stage, try to stack 2-3 Bahamuts before hitting base. This can be done by luring the peons close to base and stalling them with a few Walls and then stacking Bahamut on them.

Once you are close to hitting the base, you can start slowly sending your other meatshields, but be wary of the unit limit. 

Once you’ve hit the base, you can just turn on CPU and Sniper and let them do the job until you win. Although if you opt to use cash-drainy units like Paris, you will have to resort to spawning units manually.
