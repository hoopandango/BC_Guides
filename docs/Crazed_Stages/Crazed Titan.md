### Must-Have Units
- **Decent Attackers with >320 Range:** Paris, Drama, Dragon, Bath, etc.
- **Bahamut Cat** - One of the only non-uber Backliners that the player generally has. Due to his high damage per hit, he can one-shot Gory Black and Doge Darks. 
- **Crazed Cat** - Due to Crazed Titan having decently long foreswing and backswing, he can be stalled easily with one Crazed Cat. Also helps reduce the chance that Crazed Titan waves with its fragility

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Ring Girl Cat / Castaway** - Works very well here to quickly dispose of the Black peons with its Massive Damage to Black ability.
- **Octopus Cat** - Uncommon amongst players who are trying to beat C. Titan, but helps immensely for those who do with its ability to block waves.

### Useful Ubers
- **Generalist Ubers with >320 Range:** Catman, Twinstars, Megidora, etc. 
- **Wave Immune Attackers with >320 Range:** Li’l Valk, Shishilan Pasalan, Shadow Akira, etc. 
- **Wave Blocker Ubers:** CMK3, Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2020, etc.
- **Anti-Traitless Ubers:** Snow Miku 2021, Valiant D’arktanyan, Shadow Gao, etc.

Start off the stage by clearing out the initial Squire Rels. When the Gories arrive, keep spamming your meat shield alongside Paris Cat, who should be able to fend off the first few waves of Gories. Build up your wallet as you keep spamming these two units, until you reach max level worker, as well as filling your wallet (around 10000 should be fine) which then you send out Bahamut, and Dragon Cat.

During the battle against Crazed Titan, there’s no real strategy other than turning off your CPU when your money runs low. If you aren’t using CPU, then just spam your spammable ranged attackers manually which you should prioritise over sending Bahamut if your money is low, as he tends to miss his attacks quite often. The occasional wave attacks from Crazed Titan are completely random, and can either mess up your run, or not appear at all. Force closing a few times is most likely necessary in order to achieve the RNG needed to win.
