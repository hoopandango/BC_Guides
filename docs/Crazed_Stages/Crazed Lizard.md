### Must-Have Units
- **Tankers** - Needed here to be able to chip and kill C Lizards over time. Examples include CWhale, CTitan and Jameira.
- **Spammable Attackers** - Any units with good damage output that can deal with Ottas is important to have, as they are a large threat in this stage. AoE is not required, as there are only two Ottas per wave. Some examples include Hip Hop, Paris, Drama and Crazed Gross.

### Great-to-Have Units
- **Hacker Cat** - Outranges Crazed Lizard and deals decent chip damage. Make sure you meatshield well since they are quite fragile.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Tankers** - Units such as Hades can be used to deal good damage against Crazed Lizards, being able to to tank as well as deal good DPS.
- **Kasa Jizo** - A good spammable AoE attacker here for the Ottas.
- **Rushers** - Similar to Tankers, they can chip at Crazed Lizards, but sacrifice HP for more Damage. Examples include Yukimura and Dâ€™arktanyan.

Firstly kill the initial Mooths, send out meatshields as well as your AoE attackers, and keep sending them until they all die. Upgrade your wallet to max during this time, as you will need the extra money. Once the Crazed Lizards have spawned, lure them decently close to your base, and then start meatshielding. 

During the Otta waves, send out your AoE attackers as well as your meatshields to kill them. Crazed Whale can be used for both the Otta waves and chipping Crazed Lizards, but other tankers should generally be saved for CLizards alone. 

 If you push too much and CLizards are farther than half of the field, re-lure by spawning not spawning your AoE attackers on the next Otta wave.
