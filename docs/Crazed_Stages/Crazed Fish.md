### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut Cat** - Your main Backliner for this stage, can take off a huge chunk of HP from a stack of Crazed Fishes.
- **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Needed here to deal with the hordes of Crazed Fishes quickly. Examples include Paris, Drama and Castaway.
- **A Critical Hit Unit that can outrange Super Metal Hippoe** - Common examples include Space Cat and Jurassic Cat's True Form, Catasaurus. Do note that Jurassic Cat has to be true formed in order to work here.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Crazed Tank Cat** - Can tank a good amount of hits from Crazed Fish, making it a very good meatshield for this stage. Very helpful for consistency.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Kasa Jizo** - Can act similarly to Paris Cat and Drama Cats.
- **Anti-Traitless Ubers:** Darkâ€™tanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, etc.

Onto the main strat. At the start, use a few meatshields and a Paris to get money from the beginning Crocos, and slowly save up for Crazed Bahamut. Then, once you have enough, spawn CBahamut and spam meatshelds with a few Paris. Once you've killed the first CFish, you can start to stack more Paris's but be wary of cash and the unit limit.
 
Once you're nearing the Base, you can start spamming you critters. Then once the Super Metal Hippoe is dead, the stage should be free for you to beat.
