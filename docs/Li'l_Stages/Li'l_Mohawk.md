### Must-Have Units
- **Crimson Mina** - An LD attacker, which is needed to kill the Professor A’s in this stage. She can however be replaced by Prisoner Cat (TF required) if you do not own her. 
- **Thaumaturge** - With the high pushing power of Li’l Mohawk, Thaumaturge is essential here for controlling it. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Zamboney** - Makes stalling at the start much easier. 
- **Prisoner** - Great here for its ability to snipe Professor A and be stacked at the start for extra effectiveness. 
- **Cat God** - Can be used here to effectively cheese the level by abusing Omni mechanics.

Sniper is nice here for stalling Li’l Mohawk and stalling at the start. CPU allows for much better stalling of the boss as well 
 
Relatively straightforward with a few things to note. Lure peons and stall them close to base while you stack Mina or Prisoner if you have it. When you only have 1-2, try keeping 2 out at the same time, but when you have more, just keep 1 out and rely a bit on base HP. If there are too many on base you can try to use Sniper to pick some off. If there’s only 1 Snache on base and you have multiple desynced Minas, you can also try to rely on base HP only. 
 
After stacking as many Minas as possible, preferably around 5 or more if you can manage it, push forward and approach base and then turn on CPU and Sniper until you win or lose.
