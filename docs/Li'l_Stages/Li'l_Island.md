### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut/Ururun** - Helpful to deal with the Li’l Island hordes as generic backliners. 
- **Cyborg** - Your main source of damage for clearing the Li’l Islands. 
- **Space/Catasaurus** - Your main source of damage for killing the Super Metal Hippoe. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Research/Attack Combos** - Both “Tiny Ancient Hunt” and “Mini-Saurus” can work to good effect here. “Tiny Ancient Hunt” has Jiangshi which can be used as a meatshield here, making it effectively only take 1 slot and can help Cyborg and your critters. “Mini-saurus” can also help by making Ramen more spammable, taking effectively no slots as both units in the combo are useful here. 
- **Hoopmaster/Puppetmaster** - Can be helpful here to CC the SMH and control its hard pushing power.

> Note: This strategy can be rather inconsistent due to the very nature of Metals, so you may need to try multiple times. As an extra note, 32 Li’l Eraser and 39 Jiangshi both allow each one to survive an extra hit from Li’l Island, which can be helpful. 
 
Rich is nice here for the start off as it can be tight money wise. 
 
Rather self explanatory by the video but lets run down through it. First stall at the start with Cyborg and a few meatshields until you can get Ururun out. Then proceed to stack a few more Cyborgs and get C. Bahamut out. Continue stacking until you reach base, spamming Space as you get close to it. As an extra note here, try not to spam too many Cyborgs at the start as to not push too hard and to stall for more money.

Once you hit base start spamming Catasaurus and now it’s simply spam and pray RNG means you can kill SMH quickly. 
 
As some final notes, be wary of your cat limit and money here. As you approach base you may start to spam only a couple of meatshields (only if Li’l Islands aren’t there) and if your money starts running low, stop spamming too much and prioritise.
