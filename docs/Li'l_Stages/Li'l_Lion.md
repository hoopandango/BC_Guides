### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - Very helpful here to quickly rush down and kill the Li’l Lions. 
- **Cameraman/Chill/Cyborg** - Main sources of damage to kill and control the Li’l Lions. You can use all three if you remove BioBone or mainly Camera if you use BioBone. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **TeacherBear Cat** - Incredibly useful here if you have it for shredding Li’l Lions. 
- **BioBone** - Very useful here as it can increase the spammability of Ramen and Camera, although sacrifices 3 slots here that could be used for Cyborg/Chill and other units. 
- **Holy Valkyrie** - Can work here to CC the Li’l Lions and give some breathing room against the hard-pushing Li’l Lion horde.

Rich can help here, although it isn't needed. It helps a lot if you’re replacing BioBone with other units like Cyborg/Chill. CPU only works if you remove BioBone for other units, but can be nice if you aren’t using BioBone.

Pretty straightforward. Stall at the start with Jiangshi and Ramen + Camera to build up the wallet a bit. Awakened Bahamut can also be used to stall if the beginning Li’l Lions are too much, although try to use it somewhat earlier as to get it off cooldown once you hit base. 
 
Once you hit base, keep spamming Ramen and Camera until you get rather close to base, then spam everything excluding combo units, delaying A. Bahamut spawn a bit until the frontline stabilises. You can even spam combo units to stall if you have enough cash and are desperate, although don’t overdo it and keep an eye on your wallet. 
 
Keep spamming until the spam of Li’l Lions has died down, meaning you’ve basically won.
