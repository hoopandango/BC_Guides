### Must-Have Units
- **Ramen** - Excellent here for its ability to stall out the Angel peons and also the boss at the same time, especially when paired with Research combos. 
- **Camera/Cyborg** - Works well here to quickly dispatch the Angel peons. 
- **Crazed Bahamut** - One of few accessible options to be able to outrange Li’l Dark and put out decent damage. (Ururun is counterproductive here due to her KB) 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Li’l Nyandam/Mina/Musashi/Prisoner/Li’l King Dragon** - Basically your options for units which can outrange and deal some chip damage at the least.

Incredibly straightforward. Lure Li’l Dark a bit before then spamming Ramen and getting out Crazed Bahamut. Use Camera whenever Angelic peons like Heavenly Hippoe come.

As an extra note, try not to stack Crazed Bahamut and spawn it when the other one dies. Otherwise it’s straightforward and easy.
