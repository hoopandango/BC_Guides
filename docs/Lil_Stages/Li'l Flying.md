### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - Works nicely here to chip at Li’l Flying and dispose of Rain Ds quickly. 
- **Elemental Duelist** - Needed here to quickly dispose of Onehorns for cash. 
- **Cyborg** - Useful to help deal with both Rain Ds and Owlbrowos. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Slime** - Very helpful here, able to chip at Li’l Flying and do large amounts of damage to really everything in this level with some timing or a stepping stone. 
- **Cat God/HeALER** - Both provide viable cheese methods. Shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hofhv-iL4M) and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4gYYrTXOBU&t=106s)
- **Cataur** - Helpful here to quickly dispose of the Owlbrowos, with Massive Damage to Floating and even LD to kill Owlbrowo even if it hides behind another enemy, which it frequently does. 
- **Enchantress/Gentleman Bros** - Helps mitigate how much the One Horn can push and keep your EDuelist stack alive. 
- **Doctor** - Can be timed in when Li’l Flying is alone to regain some much needed space. 
- **Ramen** - Can work nicely here to stall enemies, especially when paired with BioBone, working as a sole meatshield.

Sniper here is nice for regaining back ground from Li’l Flying, and is one of your few methods of doing so. Breakerblast is also nice here for the same purpose, if you have it unlocked.

At the beginning of the stage, lure Li’l Flying and wait for Rain D to spawn. Once it does, lure that to base and then chain it with Awakened Bahamut as shown in the video. After this, stall Li’l Flying with Jiangshi while upgrading the wallet and wait for the other enemies to come. Now what you do is determined by what enemies are on the field. 
 
If Li’l Flying is alone, you can stall it with Jiangshi alone and try to time in Doctors to regain back space. 
 
If Rain D is there as well, spawn occasional Cyborgs to chip at Rain D. You also have the option of timing in Awakened Bahamut to kill it, which is preferable. If Owlbrowo is there, you can also spam Cataur along with Cyborg and spam Li’l Eraser as well. 
 
If One Horn is there at the frontline. Spam both Jiangshi and Li’l Eraser, along with Elemental Duelist and what anti-Red CC you have, and if Rain D is there, Cyborg as well to a limited degree.

Cycle this pattern until Li’l Flying dies, meaning you’ve won.
