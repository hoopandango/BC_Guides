### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - With the ability to output more than 100k Damage (with attack combos) and juggle the boss, he is one of the main reasons this level is such a cakewalk. 
- **Any Attack Combo** - Allows Awakened Bahamut to knockback the boss in one hit and juggle them.

If you lack any attack combo, add spammable ranged attackers like Cyborg, and ones preferably with speed to deal a little bit of chip damage to make sure you can juggle the Liâ€™l Macho Legs. Otherwise you can quite literally spawn A. Bahamut w/ an attack combo here for a free win.
