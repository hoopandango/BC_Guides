### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - Your main source of damage against Li’l Jamiera and can be nice to quickly kill Gory. 
- **Riceball/Ramen** - Good meatshields here. Riceball for stalling Li’l Jam and Ramen for Gory. As an extra note, you want a Level 33 Riceball w/ defence combo or a Level 37 Riceball without one to make stalling Li’l Jam much easier. 
- **Dancer/Cyborg** - Useful for quickly killing Gory here. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Talented Dancer** - Practically makes this stage a joke if talented. Shreds Gories and Li’l Jam. 
- **Musashi** - Can be nice for speeding up the stage if you have it.
- **Vendor/Macho Crystal Cat** - Very useful here. Able to tank Jamiera hits/waves and push it back.

Very straightforward strategy but I’ll give a short summary here. Lure at the beginning and stall for money by using Cyborg/Dancer. Upon base hit, lure again. Then stall with Ramen and timing Cyborg/Dancer for Gories. Riceball can help stall when the field is clear or Li'l Jam is too close, but be wary of cash using it. Use Tourist whenever the field is clear and Bahamut can be used here to chip at Li’l Jam or save it to kill Gory quickly.
