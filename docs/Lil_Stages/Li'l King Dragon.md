### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - Essential here and is your main source of damage for killing the Li’l King Dragons. 
- **Dancer** \[ Untalented Still Works \]/Camera/Cyborg - Any 2/all 3 work here, helpful for taking out the troublesome Gabriel/Doge Dark. 
- **Speedup/Attack Combos** - You really have an array of combos to work with here. Attack can help for killing Dragons/peons quicker. Speed-up can help with timing in A. Bahamut and let him land hits more consistently or even hit extra hits. Even Research combos can help with a high levelled Ramen.
 
### Great-To-Have Units
- **Slime** - Very nice here if you do have it. Can quickly delete the Doges and chip at Li’l King Dragon with the long reach of its wave attack. However if you use Slime here, don’t use Ramen with it. 
- **Ramen** \[~Lv 45/+ Recommended \] - A double-edged sword here, only really recommended at high levels like around level 50 or above. It can help stall nicely as a meatshield here and can even hit and chip at Dragons at higher levels, however it can prolong how long the Doges stay on the field by continuously KB’ing them, with bad synergy with Cyborg. If you also use Ramen, it is generally recommended to use BioBone or other research substitutes.

At the beginning of the stage, lure the first Dragon and the Doges close to your base before spamming meatshields and your spammable attackers to deal with the wave of Gabriels and Doge Darks. Once the second Dragon comes, assuming you’ve cleared the rest of the Doges, lure the Dragons to base to sync them up and follow the timing shown in the video to chain them. 
 
After this, just repeat in a similar fashion until Dragons stop spawning. Using your spammable attackers to deal with the peons and timing A. Bahamut in to rush them down when the path is clear of Doges, generally trying to time it in when Dragons are synced as to make your life easier, which can happen naturally over time or you can lure a bit.
