### Must-Have Units
- **Crazed Bahamut/Ururun** - Your main damage dealers for the peons and Li’l Eraser. Able to outrange and deal some decent DPS, and Ururun’s KB is also quite useful here. 
- **Cyborg** - Able to help to quickly dispose of the Dagshunds and Black Gories. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Vendor** - Able to tank a hit from Li’l Eraser and push back Li’l Eraser. Great for regaining lost space. 
- **Prisoner/LKD** - Both are among the few able to outrange Li’l Eraser and deal some decent chip damage. 
- **Cat God** - By abusing Omni-mechanics he can outrange Li’l Eraser and continuously push it back, denying it the ability to meaningfully push. 
- **Mina/Li’l Nyandam** - Only use if you’re desperate and have nothing better to put into your spare slots. While their DPS is rather poor, they outrange and are better than nothing.

Begin the stage by stalling for money. Keep Sniper on to deal with the Sir Rels at the start and spawn a Jiangshi if they hit base. Upgrade your wallet to Level 6 and wait. Once the Black Gory comes out, lure to base, spam a few meatshields and kill it with C Bahamut. Let C Bahamut push up a bit through Sniper and let it be killed by Squire Rels. Once the Owlbrowos come, stall it by spamming a few meatshields. Once Dagshund comes, spam everything except Cyborg and Tourist.

Once you hit base, you only need to basically spam meatshields and remember a few key things. Try to spawn Vendor when Li’l Eraser is alone and not at base. Spam Cyborg when Dagshunds and Black Gories come out. And as a final note, try not to have 2 Ururuns at the same time as to mitigate the chances of clipping on base and dying.
