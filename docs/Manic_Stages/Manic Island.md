### Must-Have Units
- **Dread Pirate Catley** - A core unit for the strat provided. Catley provides useful here by preventing Beserkory from attacking, with a decent stack able to juggle Beserkory and not allow it to unleash any of its devastating wave attacks. 
- **Spammable Attackers with >260 Range:** Cyborg, Drama, Dual Dragons, etc. 
- **Crazed Bahamut** - Works well enough as a generic Backliner and is one of few accessible options in the role, able to nuke the groups of enemies with his large damage per hit from a relatively safe range.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Luxury Bath Cat** - Works well as a spammable attacker here, performing similarly to Dragon Cat. However it also has the added bonus of Massive Damage towards Red, particularly useful for quickly killing Berserkory here.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Ranged Wave Blockers:** Tokyo Miku 2020 CC, Eva-00, etc. 
- **Anti-Red Nukers:** Thundia, Pai-Pai, Eva 02, etc. 
- **High-DPS Mid-rangers:** Li’l Valk, Divine Kalisa, etc. 
- **Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners):** Catman, Nurse, etc. 
- **Epicfest Exclusives:** Dark’tanyan, Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, etc. 
- **Kasa Jizo** - Works basically as a better version of Cyborg/Drama Cats.

Now onto the actual strategy. At the beginning, you can use a few spammable attackers to clear out the Crocos and gain some quick money. Once the first Manic Island begins to arrive, begin to spam meatshields and start stacking up your spammable ranged attackers on it, and continue to stack up spammable ranged attackers on the next waves. Past the start off and as you push forward, begin to stack up Catleys.

As you get close to the base, stop your meatshielding. Assuming you’ve built up a decent stack up to this point, you can mostly just spam until you’ve won. Once Beserkory is dead, your win is practically secured, and you can begin spamming meatshields again, although be careful of the dangerous Brollow wave which can appear after the Beserkory is dead if you use this strat.
