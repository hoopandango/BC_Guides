### Must-Have Units
- **Cameraman Cat** - An excellent spammable attacker for dealing with both JK Bun Bun and Shy Boy with its cost efficiency and Strong vs Floating ability.
- **Sanzo Cat** - Helpful here for its ability to shut down JK Bun Buns and Shy Boys pushing power.
- **Awakened Bahamut Cat (Without Rich Cat)** - When Shy Boys are being slowed by Sanzo near the outside of Manic Dark’s range, Awakened Bahamut is key to kill these Shy Boys as fast as possible, giving you money to ease the money-tight start-off without a Rich Cat item. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Can Can (With Double Bounty Talent)** - Can Can Cat is very useful for sniping Sir Seals with double bounty, especially useful for the money-tight start off. Can Can can also dish out some nice supplementary DPS and CC against the Shy Boys and JK Bun Bun as well.
- **King Dragon/Crazed Dragon Cat(s)** - Dragons provide good and stackable damage that substantially outranges all enemies (besides Nyandam) in this stage.
- **Luxury Bath Cat** - Luxury Bath Cat performs similarly to King Dragon/Crazed Dragon, but also provides 4x the damage against the Shy Boys and J.K Bun Bun.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Floating/Red Nukers:** B.C.S Lionheart, Divine Windy, Catman, etc. 
- **Epicfest Exclusives:** Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, Dark’tanyan, etc.

> **Note:** You may have noticed that the levels for this run are rather high. This is due to the fact that MDark will usually be your last manic done due to its high difficulty and also rather useless drop.

Rich and CPU are reccomended because the lack of beginning cash and how much you'll be spamming. Sniper can also be useful for cleanup. 
 
Start immediately spamming dual Erasers to stall, then spawn 1 Sanzo and 1 Can Can to kill the Seal. Once you kill the Seal, Shy Boys will shortly come after, start spamming everything except your Backliners. Once you gain cash from killing Shy Boys, spawn Bahamut. 

Shortly after, J.K Bun Bun will spawn. Turn on CPU and watch the fight until J.K. Bun Bun dies. Be wary of your wallet and turn off CPU and spam manually if it gets too low. 

After J.K. Bun Bun dies, turn off CPU and slowly chip MDark. This is an tedious and long part, but spawning Can Can for Seals and cycling backliners is key.
