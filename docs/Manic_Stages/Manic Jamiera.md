### Must-Have Units
- **Octopus Cat** - The main core unit which this strategy focuses around, with its ability to block waves being incredibly helpful here.
- **Decent Attackers with >320 Range:** Drama, Dual Dragons, Cyborg, etc.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Pizza / Seafarer** - While outranged, both can work well to help quickly dispatch of the troublesome peons here, although I generally prefer Pizza here if you have both.
- **Vendor** - Despite being outranged by MJam, Vendor can work well to land a few hits off on MJam to push back and gain back ground from MJam.
- **Ururun** - Not only works well as a ranged attacker to chip at MJam and deal with peons but also has a chance to KB which can be nice to push back the boss and gain back some ground.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Wave Immune Ubers with >320 Range:** Shishilan, Liâ€™l Valk, etc.
- **Wave Blocker Ubers:** Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2021, CMK3, etc.
- **Epicfest Exclusives:** Valiant D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, etc.

> **Note:** If you lack Octopus, you can replace BioBone and Octopus for more ranged attackers or other units that can work well here. However unless you have ubers that are hard carries, the stage will become much more RNG-reliant and generally harder without Octopus.

At the beginning you can stall for money by killing the peons with a few attackers and then letting those attackers be killed, luring and repeating this until you have a max wallet and near full cash. Once you have max cash you can just pretty much spam your ranged attackers, MS and Octo throughout until you win and save Pizza (or Seafarer) to quickly dispatch of the troublesome peons.

On an extra note, if you do elect to bring particularly money-drainy units like Cyborg, be wary of how much cash you have and to restrict or stop spamming your attackers should your cash go too low.
