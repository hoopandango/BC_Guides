### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - An essential unit if you don’t have Octopus. Its incredibly high DPS makes it valuable for juggling and quickly killing the MML before they can stack up. 
- **Spammable Ranged Attackers:** Dual Dragons, Cyborg, Drama, Macho Legs, etc. 
- **Vendor Cat** - Another essential unit here if you don’t have Octopus. Its ability to frequently KB and shortly freeze Traitless enemies proving very useful here to juggle MML here. [Possible without Vendor and Octo but requires a much larger boost for attackers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEd8ZQuMo8o)

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Octopus Cat** - Practically breaks the stage if you do own him. Spamming a few meatshields, Octopus, some spammable ranged attackers and A. Baha (if you have it) lead to an easy win. 

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Epicfest Exclusives:** Shadow Gao, Dark Kasli, Valiant D’arktanyan, etc. 
- **Wave Immune Ubers:** Shishilan, Immortal Keiji, Li’l Valk, etc. 
- **Wave Blocker Ubers:** CMK3, Eva-00, Tokyo Miku 2020, etc.

> **Note:** the strategy can be inconsistent, with many things that can possibly go wrong, seemingly for no reason. This consistency increases and decreases depending on your unit levels, with this strategy being executable with lower levels like Lv20 C. Dragon, however just being more inconsistent.
 
Both Rich and Sniper are rather important. With the amount of attackers you’re spamming, you need Rich and Sniper can help give you a bit more time to juggle the MMLs. Cool Japan can also be replaced by any other attack combo if you don’t have it. Now onto the main strategy.

At the beginning, lure the first MML near your base. From here there’s a few different ways to execute the start off (when you first spawn your attackers, when you spawn A. Baha and when you spawn Vendor), but following the video in question the setup is simple. Wait until around 10500c before spawning a single Cyborg, let it be attacked by the first MML before then quickly spawning Vendor and other spammable attackers after the wave has passed the base. After Vendor hits MML, immediately spawn A. Bahamut. From here, just spam your spammable ranged attackers until your victory.
