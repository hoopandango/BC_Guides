### Must-Have Units
- **Ururun Wolf** - A rather essential unit here. Apart from working well as a generic Backliner that can chip at Manic Eraser, its fast attack rate and ability to 1HKB the Black Gories at level 30 mean Ururun works especially well here to control the dangerous Black Gories and its chance to KB also allows it to regain ground from Manic Eraser. 
- **Crazed Bahamut** - One of your few accessible options for a generic Backliner, and can work well enough as one to chip away at MEraser and deal with peons. 
- **King Dragon/Crazed Dragon** - Works well here as a generic spammable attacker which can outrange the boss, able to chip at the boss and help deal with peons. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Pizza** - Works very well to quickly dispatch the dangerous Gory Black waves. There are alternatives to this role, Seafarer and Drama also working to help dispatch the Gory Black waves, although working less well compared to Pizza. 
- **Cyberpunk** - Works well here to provide decent CC from a very safe range to control peons and the boss, and can also provide some small chip damage as well. 
- **Luxury Bath** - Acts similarly to Dragons here, outranging Manic Eraser and able to deal some chip damage towards the boss and deal with peons well, while also having Massive Damage to Red, allowing it to dispatch Capy quickly.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners):** Catman, Nurse, Megidora, etc. 
- **Shadow Gao** - Works well here as an above-average Backliner and can nuke the boss with its Massive Damage toward Traitless ability.

Sniper is very important here as MEraser with its 1KB means it's basically a wall, with no chance to regain back precious space with normal damage KBs. Therefore you need ways to regain back this space, Sniper being one of the few ways to do this.

Now onto the actual strategy. For the start off you can just wait and build up your wallet. Eventually, Gory Black will come and you can spam a few meatshields and use Pizza to quickly dispatch them. After this, get Cyberpunk and don’t spawn anything until Owlbrows appear. Once it does, spam dual Erasers until Capy comes out you can basically spam everything except Pizza. 
 
Once you’ve triggered base, there isn’t much strategy apart from spamming everything, with the exception of Pizza, until MEraser eventually dies, although there are a few things to take into consideration. Pizza should be saved for dealing with the Black Gories waves. Depending on the distance MEraser is from your base, you can usually send out Pizza when Capy comes out so that the 2nd Pizza arrives at the frontline around about when the Black Gories come. Ururun should also NOT be stacked here. If you have 1 Ururun on the field and can spawn another one, do NOT spawn another one. This is because it can end up causing KB to proc too much, and end up in your units clipping into MEraser and dying. Due to this, it’s usually better to just save Ururun until the current one on the field is dead.
