### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - Works very well here to rush down and chip at Manic Flying and can also be used to chain and quickly dispose of Rain Ds. 
- **iCat** - Works well here as a consistent means to control the Bores that spawn with its guaranteed freeze with a decent uptime. Alternatives exist to deal with Bore, although perform considerably worse. Examples include Roe, Cancan and Enchantress. 
- **Seafarer** - Very useful here for its ability to consistently control the Nimroy Bores with a mostly consistent freeze proc while also having decent DPS to work as an attacker. Alternatives exist, although perform considerably worse. Examples include Corrupted Psychocat. 
- **Cyborg** - Works as a ranged attacker that can help to dispatch the Rain Ds, other alternatives like King Dragon and Drama also work similarly. 
 
### Great-To-Have Units
- **Cyberpunk** - Long ranged CC which can provide decent control over everything from a comfortably safe distance and can deal some small chip damage to the boss. 
- **Fishman** - A good anti-Floating Rusher who can deal good chip damage towards MFlying when it’s alone. 
- **Sadako** - Useful here for its ability to weaken MFlying, able to weaken it and make your other means of chipping at MFlying (Abaha, Fishman) survive longer and do more damage when MFlying is alone, speeding up the process of chipping at and killing MFlying. 
- **Cancan** - Useful for its good damage output against both Bores and can chip at MFlying. Slow proc can also be nice as well here. Notably, at level 38 and Speed Up talents, it can reliably hit Rain D, making killing Rain D much quicker and easier. 
- **Sniper the Recruit** - Useful here with its high range and guaranteed chance to KB, able to KB MFlying from a safe distance, regaining lost ground from MFlying and the peons. 
 
### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Lufalan Pasalan** - Outranges MFlying here and with a lack of peons spammed here, Lufalan can fully utilise his massive DPS to nuke the peons and deal great damage to the boss. 
- **Ultima Galaxy Cosmos** - Acts similarly to Sniper the Recruit, although it also has the added benefit of having some chip damage to boot and if TF’d has long freeze duration in which you can rush down MFlying. 
- **Rushers** - Generic Rushers can benefit your lineup in a similar manner to A. Bahamut. 
- **Greater Balrog** - Very nice here for its ability to do massive amounts of damage toward everything here.

At the beginning of the stage, lure MFlying and lure Rain. D to the base. Then, chain it with Awakened Bahamut as shown in the video. After Rain D dies, stall MFlying with CCat and spawn Cyberpunk. Now what you do after this point depends on the enemies on the field. 

If MFlying is alone, you can spam CCat to preserve money and occasionally time in Fishman for some damage. If MFlying is with Rain. D, you can spam CCat and CWall and spawn Cyborg occasionally to deal some chip damage to the Rain Ds. If 2 or more Rain Ds stack up with MFlying, you can lure them and chain them with Bahamut. 

For the Bores, spam all your meatshields alongside Cancan, Castaway and your anti-Alien/Red depending on the Bore to dispatch it. You can spawn Cyborg here to deal some chip damage, make sure not to spam too much or else you’ll drain cash. 

Spawn Cyberpunk whenever possible and try to desync them if you can as two or three well desynced Cyberpunks make the stage much easier.

Repeat this cycle until you win.
