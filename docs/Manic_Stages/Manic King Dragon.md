### Must-Have Units
- **Awakened Bahamut** - To rush down the Manic King Dragons and deal a huge amount of damage to them. 
- **Spammable Attackers:** Camera, Pizza, C. UFO, Can-can, Seafarer, etc. Used to take down the Otta-smack-u waves. 
- **Fishman** - Mainly for the starting Mooths, Fishman makes dealing with them much easier. 

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Cyberpunk Cat** - Chips down the Manic King Dragons, as well as bonus Crowd Control and can kill some of the weaker peons like the Snaches and Crocos.

### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Kasa Jizo** - A good spammable attacker, like the other spammable attackers it's used to take down the Otta-smack-u waves.
- **Tankers** - Examples include Dark Beastlord Garu, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Keiji, etc. They are used to tank and deal out heavy damage to the Manic King Dragons as well as do very good damage to the Otta-smack-u waves. 
- **Rushers** - Examples include Immortal Yukimura, Valiant D'arktanyan, Legeluga, etc. These can be used in a similar manner to Awakened Bahamut, used to rush down and chip at the bosses.
- **Super Galaxy Cosmo** - Like Cyberpunk, it can be used to chip down the Manic King Dragons.
- **Balalan Pasalan** - His very long range and freeze ability can be useful to give Awakened Bahamut an easier time to take down the Manic King Dragons, as well as give some breathing time from dealing with the Otta-smack-u waves.

For the start off, lure the Mooths and use Cancan and Fishman to kill them quickly, also getting out Cyberpunk when you can.
 
When the Ottas come, spam all your meatshields and your spammable attackers to quickly kill them. Try to spawn only 2-4 CUFOs though to conserve cash. 

When MKDs are alone, spam MEraser and spawn Cyberpunk whenever possible (and Tankers if you bring them). Save up Bahamut to rush down MKDs, preferably doing so when they’re synced or nearly synced to make timing easier. If they’re desynced, wait for them to push up a bit and use Cat Cannon to sync them. You can use TBolt to freeze the MKDs and time Bahamut, but that requires at least level 4 TBolt. 

This repeats until you kill the MKDs. Do keep in mind that there are 6 extra MKDs in base and if you mess up destroying base you may have to deal with the stage all over again.
