### Must-Have Units
- **Spammable AoE Attackers** - Your main damage dealers in the fight. Any decent attacker works. There is not much concern for cost, and your priority should be spammability and raw DPS. Examples include Cameraman Cat, Drama Cat, Crazed U.F.O, Chill Cat, Cyborg Cat and many more.
- **Awakened Bahamut Cat** - Awakened Bahamut has the highest non-uber DPS in the game, and provided he is protected well, he can dish out huge amounts of damage to the Manic Lion horde.

### Great-To-Have Units
- **Holy Valkyrie Cat** - Works for her Freeze, which can provide some breathing space against the Lion horde, although can be inconsistent.
- **Healer Cat CC** - Useful here similar to Valk, being much more consistent with 100% proc, but a bit more risky with its lower range and non-existent HP.
 
### Useful Uber Rare Units
- **Kasa Jizo** - Performs well as a good spammable attacker here.
- **Anti-Traitless Ubers** - As expected, they do very well here (Eg. D’arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Gothic Mitama, Black Zeus, Snow Miku.
- **Any Uber with High AoE DPS** - More damage for the Manic Lions. Preferably has short foreswing and high damage per hit (Eg. Li’l Valk, Kalisa, Cradle, etc. )

### Lineups And Strategies

CPU and Rich are reccomended as you'll be spamming alot of units in the stage. 

First off, spawn one Crazed UFO and start spamming 3 of your meatshields until the first Manic Lion is dead. After the first Manic Lion dies, let your cats reach and attack the base. After triggering the base, the next thing to do is to lure them around 3/4 of the field (adjustable depending on your own experience). 

After that, spam everything except Bahamut. When HValk gets a freeze, turn on CPU. If Awakened Bahamut gets out good hits, you should be fine to win. 

There can be some stuff that can go wrong and make it a bit inconsistent. For example, Holy Valkyrie not getting the necessary freeze or Awakened Bahamut will get hit by synced Manic Lions and get 1 shot, but this is sadly RNG-dependent so all you can do is retry.
