While guidemakers do try to accommodate for the most people when making their guides, it is not uncommon to miss an essential gacha unit that is in lineup or for guides to have overlevelled normals or Manics and yours aren\u2019t quite that high. If a guide has a Level 35 Octopus and yours is only 30, it is common sense to understand that 30 is most likely sufficient, unless stated otherwise. Of course the levels required are rather fluid and can depend on your units, lower levels usually being compensated by other means like ubers. If you lack a gacha unit from the recommended lineup, while not a good sign, doesn\u2019t always mean that you are unable to win with said strat. There are many alternatives listed and/or ubers that can most likely compensate. In general, however, you don\u2019t need to follow a recommended lineup 1 to 1. We try to make the lineups shown as accessible as possible, and such some lineups may have missing slots, but if you have something that works well here, fill in those slots. Try to adapt a recommended lineup around your levels and units. If you think you have a good uber or better alternative for something in a recommended lineup, go for it.","title":"Preface"},{"location":"Crazed_Stages/Crazed%20Axe/","text":"Must-Have Units \u00b6 Crazed Bahamut Cat - One of your few accessible Backliner options which can outrange C.

He is able to chip down both Rain D. and Crazed Bird, as well as having Strong vs Red, making him very useful for the Bore waves.

Great-To-Have Units \u00b6 Swimmer Cat - Has Massive DMG vs Floating as well as good speed, allowing him to chip Crazed Bird consistently, speeding up the process. Can also be used during the Bore and Shy Boy waves. Kotatsu Cat - Has Resistant vs Floating as well as 50% chance to weaken Crazed Bird, allowing your Crazed Whales to chip more consistently as they can tank for longer. Do not send this unit during Bore waves as they will die fast. Hip Hop Cat - Works to chip Crazed Bird if no Rain Ds are alive, and works on the Bore phase as well, having a 40% chance to slow him and deal good damage. Sniper the Recruit - Able to outrange CBird, as well as having a 100% chance to KB, allowing you to gain back ground from Crazed Bird. Other Anti-Red Units - Units such as Swordsman Cat, Bath Cat, Sushi Cat, can all work against the Bores, making them much easier to deal with. Useful Uber Rare Units \u00b6 Backliner Ubers - Ubers with decent range can be a good replacement for Bahamut during Bore waves, allowing you to keep more ground. A good example is Thundia. Rusher Ubers - Ubers such as D\u2019arktanyan or Yukimura who have high speeds can be used to rush down Crazed Bird, dealing a good amount of damage. Tanker Ubers - High-HP Ubers such as Hades will be able to tank Crazed Bird and Rain Ds, as well as dealing good damage.

If Li\u2019l Flying is alone, you can stall it with Jiangshi alone and try to time in Doctors to regain back space. If Rain D is there as well, spawn occasional Cyborgs to chip at Rain D. You also have the option of timing in Awakened Bahamut to kill it, which is preferable. If Owlbrowo is there, you can also spam Cataur along with Cyborg and spam Li\u2019l Eraser as well.

This is due to the fact that MDark will usually be your last manic done due to its high difficulty and also rather useless drop. Rich and CPU are reccomended because the lack of beginning cash and how much you'll be spamming. Sniper can also be useful for cleanup. Start immediately spamming dual Erasers to stall, then spawn 1 Sanzo and 1 Can Can to kill the Seal. Once you kill the Seal, Shy Boys will shortly come after, start spamming everything except your Backliners. Once you gain cash from killing Shy Boys, spawn Bahamut. Shortly after, J.K Bun Bun will spawn. Turn on CPU and watch the fight until J.K. Bun Bun dies. Be wary of your wallet and turn off CPU and spam manually if it gets too low. After J.K. Bun Bun dies, turn off CPU and slowly chip MDark. This is an tedious and long part, but spawning Can Can for Seals and cycling backliners is key.","title":"Cameraman + Sanzo Strat"},{"location":"Manic_Stages/Manic%20Eraser/","text":"Must-Have Units \u00b6 Ururun Wolf - A rather essential unit here.

Therefore you need ways to regain back this space, Sniper being one of the few ways to do this. Now onto the actual strategy. For the start off you can just wait and build up your wallet. Eventually, Gory Black will come and you can spam a few meatshields and use Pizza to quickly dispatch them. After this, get Cyberpunk and don\u2019t spawn anything until Owlbrows appear. Once it does, spam dual Erasers until Capy comes out you can basically spam everything except Pizza. Once you\u2019ve triggered base, there isn\u2019t much strategy apart from spamming everything, with the exception of Pizza, until MEraser eventually dies, although there are a few things to take into consideration. Pizza should be saved for dealing with the Black Gories waves. Depending on the distance MEraser is from your base, you can usually send out Pizza when Capy comes out so that the 2nd Pizza arrives at the frontline around about when the Black Gories come. Ururun should also NOT be stacked here. If you have 1 Ururun on the field and can spawn another one, do NOT spawn another one. This is because it can end up causing KB to proc too much, and end up in your units clipping into MEraser and dying. Due to this, it\u2019s usually better to just save Ururun until the current one on the field is dead.","title":"Manic Eraser"},{"location":"Manic_Stages/Manic%20Eraser/#must-have-units","text":"Ururun Wolf - A rather essential unit here.

Now what you do after this point depends on the enemies on the field. If MFlying is alone, you can spam CCat to preserve money and occasionally time in Fishman for some damage. If MFlying is with Rain. D, you can spam CCat and CWall and spawn Cyborg occasionally to deal some chip damage to the Rain Ds. If 2 or more Rain Ds stack up with MFlying, you can lure them and chain them with Bahamut. For the Bores, spam all your meatshields alongside Cancan, Castaway and your anti-Alien/Red depending on the Bore to dispatch it. You can spawn Cyborg here to deal some chip damage, make sure not to spam too much or else you\u2019ll drain cash.

Make sure that they are not synced Due to their differing weakens, do not use Thaumaturge and Driller together. Cyberpunk Cat - Very useful here to CC MMohawk, able to be stacked to great effect, shown here. Make sure to desync them and 4-5 are optimal.","title":"Great-To-Have Units"},{"location":"Manic_Stages/Manic_Mohawk/#useful-uber-rare-units","text":"Bahamut Replacements (Generic Backliners) - The player can replace Crazed Bahamut with any Backliner uber, provided they are levelled (Eg.

At the beginning, lure the weak peons to base and stack Medalist or other stackable LD on them. You can initially stall them with a C. Wall/Eraser, but once you have a good stack, try to rely on base HP. Once your base HP is low or you feel like your stack is large enough, turn on CPU. Once boss wave is triggered, use Cannon soon after to let your Medalist stack survive a bit longer. From here, just be wary of your wallet and spam manually should it get too low.","title":"Medalist Stack Strat"}]}
